# About Me
I'm a systems administrator, novice programmer, and philosophy enthusiast.

I specialize in Linux systems, but I'm procient in Windows 2003-2012 as well as a little bit of OSX. My day to day is baby sitting servers, making sure websites serve correctly, and emails are sending/receiving.  At night you'll find me working on my homelab, various technology that I find interesting, or riding my bicycle around downtown Phoenix.
