                                <p>My name is Chris and this is my landing page. This is also a learning project for me, it's my first website after learning HTML/CSS.</p>
                                <p>A few important things about me are, i'm a<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skepticism'>skeptic</a>. I'm also a strong advocate of the<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-agression_principle'>Non-aggression principle</a>. I'm sure you can deduce from the last two sentences that i'm interested in philosophy. I enjoy discussing philosphy with friends and applying it to my personal life.</p>

                                <p>I'm also very into riding my bicycle. For a short time i lived in Flagstaff, AZ and relied soley on my bike for transportation, and i loved it.  Ever since then i've tried to drive my car as little as possible.
                                <p>I participate in a few local bike organizations like<a href='http://www.criticalmassphoenix'>Critical Mass</a>,<a href='http://www.bikesaviours.org'>Bike Saviours</a>and like love to join more like<a href='http://www.phxbikelab.org'>PHX Bikelab</a>,<a href='http://www.rustyspoke.org'>Rusty Spoke</a>,and<a href='http://www.phoenixspokespeople.org'>Phoenix Spokes People</a>.</p>

                                <p>Another huge interest of mine is computers. Computers are a giant category and i tend not to descriminate. I love the<a href='http://www.raspberrypi.org/faqs'>Raspberry Pi</a>computer, and in fact this site is hosted on a Raspberry Pi, which is being powered by my router's USB plug.</p>
                                <p>I'm a big fan of the<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux'>Linux</a>operating system, and typically stick with Debian based distributions, but i've touched on Arch based distros.</p>
                                <p>Android modification is another interesting subject to me. I pre-ordered the<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTC_Dream'>HTC Dream (T-mobile G1)</a>,the very first Android phone. Shortly after i got that phone i started installing custom ROMs. I usually stick close to<a href='http://www.cyanogenmod.com'>Cyanogenmod</a>or roms based on Cyanogenmod. An effect of my interest in Android phones, i usually don't stick with the same phone for more than a year.
